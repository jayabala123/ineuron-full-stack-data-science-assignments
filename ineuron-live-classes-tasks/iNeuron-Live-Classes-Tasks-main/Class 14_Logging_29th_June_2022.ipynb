        "Suppose we have a big project consisting of tasks such as Loading Data, Merging Data, Filtering out Data , Storing a data in database etc. If suppose code stops execution and shows error, then how can a perosn who is monitoring the project would understand the problem? To maintain the standard of the project, we cannot use print statement to solve this problem. Also we dont have console access all the time. To solve this, we use **LOGGING**. We can either create a single log file for whole project or multiple log files for each of the processes involved in the project.\n",
